# Application compatibility cache

The Application compatibility cache can be found in the following Windows
Registry keys.

In Windows 2000 and XP:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatibility
```

In Windows 2003 and later:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache
```

Note that several sources claim that the Application Compatibility Cache is
part of the [Application Compatibility Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/application-compatibility-database).
However unfortunately these claims are not backed by sources or facts. Since
the previous article does not mention the relationship between the cache and
the database, this document the Application Compatibility Cache to part of
the Windows Application Compatibility subsystem instead.

Note that the actual difference between the Application Compatibility Cache
and Shim (Database) Cache is currently unknown. Be aware that in other sources
the terms can be used interchangeable. Since MSDN explicitly defines
BaseFlushAppcompatCache and ShimFlushCache, there is likely a subtle difference
to what data is cached. Also see: [Understanding Shims](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/dd837644(v=ws.10)).

## Windows 2000

Windows 2000 stores Application Compatibility related data in subkeys in:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatibility
```

At this time it is unclear if these subkeys serve the same purpose as the
AppCompatCache value in later versions of Windows.

The subkeys are named as the executable files e.g. `Uninstall.exe` and have been
seen to contain the following values:

Name | Data type | Description
--- | --- | ---
%NAME% | | <mark style="background-color: yellow">**Unknown (seen: x, 462)**</mark>
DllPatch-%NAME% | | <mark style="background-color: yellow">**Unknown**</mark>

Also seen values named like `00008 WindowsNT4.0`.

### Windows 2000 unknown value
